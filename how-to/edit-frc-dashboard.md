# Editing the FRC Dashboard
#### Note: Steps are Windows Specific

- Open LabView
- Create a new dashboard project with a name that makes sense
- A smaller window called project explorer will pop up. Double click on the file labeled `main.vi`
- After you do this, two new windows will appear:
    - A large window with your custom dashboard
    - A smaller window with everything you can put in the dashboard tabs
- Make the changes necessary.
- In the project explore window, under build specifications, right click FRC_Dashboard.
- Click build
- Click explore
- Find the build file and copy it to `C:/Program Files/FRC Dashboard`
- Inside `C:/Users/Public/Public Documents/FRC`, open `FRC DS Data storage` and change `Dashboardcmd` from `dashboard.exe` to the name of your build file
- Run the dashboard!
